Continue Authentication and customers page
- Migrate all the fields from the customer table to the the `/customers` page.
- Implement logout. The button already exists in customers list page. Implement a servlet for the URL it goes to.
The servlet should call "invalidate()" on the session and redirect the user to the login page.
